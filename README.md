Gaining insights into the neural processes underlying higher cognitive functions, including object recognition, visual awareness, intelligent behavior, and learning from experience, holds significant importance. The ability to address mental diseases and disorders and advance cognitive capabilities relies heavily on our understanding of these underlying neural mechanisms. The current understanding suggests that cognitive functions emerge from intricate interactions among various specialized brain regions and extensive networks of diverse neurons with distinct morphologies and functions. These neurons communicate through complex spatiotemporal patterns of electrical and chemical signals. Given this complexity, many neural mechanisms responsible for various cognitive abilities still remain undiscovered. The integration of vast amounts of data required to decipher the intricate interplay among different brain regions presents a substantial challenge. To bridge this knowledge gap, new data analysis tools, as well as computer models and simulations, will be indispensable in unraveling the intricate processes behind cognitive abilities.

In the following, codes written and to be used in Matlab are provided to implement CNN models in relatively straight-forward and simple fashion.
